title: How and Why?
---

I've tried to start a blog before, but those attempts collapse pretty quickly. Hopefully this time will be different. I think in large part those attempts where doomed from the start because they never had a purpose, I wanted a blog because having a blog sounded like a cool idea not because I had anything in particular that I felt needed to be said or done. Obviously this analysis poses some questions, such as what do I intend to do with this blog and why am I writing this now? 

There are a couple of different ways to explain this, though probably easiest place to start is that I simply miss writing. On a day to day basis writing complete sentences is a rarity for me, when I do get the chance it is in the form of laboratory reports. Any kernel of the experience of writing is swamped by contrived experimental designs, deadlines and the other assorted paraphernalia of undergraduate life. Last year my occasional scribblings for a student magazine allowed me some opportunity explore my thoughts in writing, but this year that avenue has been closed off. 

It is oddly enough from the ghost of one these abandon projects that the inspiration and the opportunity for these Promethean Dreams arose. Sometime in the overambitious early days of the previous summer I downloaded some blogging software, a fact I had long since forgotten. When recently my computer refused to install it's updates it was this software that that turned out to be be the culprit. In searching for a way to resolve this issue I made a discovery - github were offering free hosting for Jekyll based blogs.

This was the catalyst that set things in motion, while the there were plenty of free blogging services many of which had briefly caught my eye here everything fell smoothly into place as my desire to write dovetailed with my technical aspirations. I had quite independently intended to get to grips with github and the associated open-source ecosystem, now  I had a source of motivation and a ready made topic to fill up my blog. Now became the perfect time to make a renewed strike on the blogosphere. Even if I fail again it's become worth doing for the technical learning experience alone.

Yet if I intend to start a blog then this time it will be with purpose. Part of that purpose is immediately obvious, If this is in part to be a technical project it will also be a project in documenting my misadventures in IT. There's already much I'm eager to right about following the guide (QQQ) here to construct this blog, but that will have to wait.
